I am so happy I am nearly finished
Maybe I am not so bad after all? 
It's possible.
It is 7:20 AM. I have to complete my homework for Modernism and Computer Science III. 
Modernism: Read 40 more pages (50 minutes)
Computer Science III: Finish up to Make a Pull Request on Lesson 3 on Udacity (30 minutes?)
I will make breakfast and eat while reading Modernism. This should work fine! :) 

I will finish Mobile Homework during 10:35-12:00 period before 12:15 class. 
After class, I will do Poetry from 3:30-4:30, then I will mail my letter to Joseph (once I find a stamp).
Hooray!
